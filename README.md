This is the code for the NeurIPS submission, entitled "Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning"

There is a iPython Notebook for the demo.

For demo:
	demo_BOIL_A2C_InvPendulum.py is for running BOIL on A2C with InvertedPendulum-v2
	demo_BOIL_A2C_Reacher.py is for running BOIL on A2C with Reacher-v2
	demo_BOIL_DDQN_CartPole_2D_for_plot.py is for running BOIL on DDQN with CartPole for plotting.
